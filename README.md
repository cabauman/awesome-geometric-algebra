# Geometric Algebra Cheat Sheet

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**
```math
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
```

This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline: $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$

## PGA

### Vocabulary

- Cl(3, 0, 1)
- ideal norm
- euclidean norm
- study number
- bi-reflection, quad-reflection
- Pseudoscalar
- basis vector
- vector
- basis blade
- blade
- grade
- multivector
- bivector, trivector, quadvector
- rotor: for rotations
- motor: translation + rotation; normalized even multivectors. Even means that they include both scalar (grade0) and bivector (grade2) parts (and a quadvector (grade4) part in the case of screw motion).
- translator: A general translator in 3D PGA is ±1 + (xe₀₁ + ye₀₂ + ze₀₃)/2 to translate a distance of (x, y, z) in their respective directions. Since a translator's bivector part always has a norm of 0, the translator's norm comes entirely from the scalar, so if it's normalized it will always be either 1 or -1. As for the square root, the square root of a translator does indeed half the bivector part, but not the scalar part, which stays at 1 or -1.
- rotor/motor sqrt: The square root of a motor in PGA is actually a special case of the bisector formula, where the mid-point/bisector of objects a and b is normalized(a + b). In the case of a motor square root, one of those objects is the identity motor, also known as 1.
- simple bivectors (squares to a scalar) & rotors/motors (composed of 2 reflections)
- non-simple bivector (squares to a study number) & rotors/motors (composed of 4 reflections aka screw motion)
- rotor/motor log -> bivector
- bivector exp -> rotor/motor
- Scaling is not present in PGA but *uniform* scaling is in Conformal GA (CGA)
- intuitive naming: rotate_point_around_line(P, L, theta)

 ### Operations

- inner product: Inner product acting on multivectors. For basis vectors gives the values as defined by the algebra
- wedge product: Used for join in ordinary representations and meet in dual representations. Zero for parallel vectors. Orthogonal vectors don't simplify and are written with a shorthand notation. Orthogonal vectors anti-commute
- geometric product: The ordinary product. For vectors can be expanded into a sum of inner and wedge product
- Square: Ambiguous. Often AA or A~A which sometimes give the same result and sometimes don't
- Inverse: The inverse of an element is defined such that multiplying it with the element results in 1. A left inverse is an inverse such that it results in 1 when multiplied from the left, and similarly for right inverses. Not every element has an inverse.
- Division: A/B, Ambiguous. Can mean left or right multiplication by the inverse of B, which is sometimes but not always the same
- Commutator: axb=ab-ba Zero if a and b commute under the geometric product. 2ab if they anti-commute
- Grade Selection: Keeps only the grade n parts
- Scalar Grade Selection: Same as Grade Selection with n=0. Keeps only the scalar part.
- reverse: Reverses the order of basis vectors in products
- dual: Gives a complementary element. For degenerate algebras the dual is zero. However we can still get a useful non-metric complement by assuming 
 which is usually just called the dual too.
- Vee Product: Used for meet in ordinary representations and join in dual representations. Usually implemented with the wedge product and taking duals


### Rotors & Motors

#### Circular Motion

**Question**: Let's say you have two points p and q on the unit circle. You want to interpolate the circular motion between p and q, where the arc of motion is perpendicular to the unit circle. What ways are there of doing this in GA?

**Answer**: Calling your two points a and b, and the center of the circle c, the arc-length parametrised (by alpha) motion is exp(0.5 * alpha * log((c&b)/(c&a))). (where & is the regressive product and * the geometric product). 

read : 
- c&b, c&a : lines from c to b and a
- ratio of two lines = twice the rotor between them
- log of that rotor is a bivector 
- 0.5*alpha because we started from twice the rotor.

**Question**: The centre of the circle needs to be found though
The circle which the arc is contained in, has to meet the unit circle at a right angle.
Basically, you need to find the quantity c, and then that should be OK.
c would be the meet of the tangents to the unit circle at a and b, by elementary circle geometry.

**Answer**: the tangents at a and b are given by (o&a)|a and (o&b)|b respectively (see my GAME2020 lecture 😉). This gives
c = ((o&a)|a)^((o&b)|b)

#### asdf

Starting in 4D (e.g. 3DPGA or R4), the norm of a bivector (sqrt(B * ~B)) is no longer necessarily a scalar. Instead it'll end up being a Study number.
